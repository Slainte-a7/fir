Sun I call burning wheel
Sword I call wolf of steel

Star I call sword of light
Rune I call sign in stone

Man I call tree that thinks
Earth I call grave of men

God I call not of earth
Sky I call home of gods

Sea I call flock of waves
Ship I call horse at sea

Mount I call giant dead
Wind I call Midgard's breath

Life I call kiss of gods
Fire I call wrath of life

Love I call lust for more
Child I call made of love

Name I call eternal life
Worth I call what lives on
